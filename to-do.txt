Here's a todo list from the instructions, add your dev tasks here so we can all see progress!

PeerTrack+ Hackathon Planning Todo List

1. Deliverables Planning
[ ] Decide format: mockup, prototype, or concept demo
[ ] Outline 7–10 minute presentation / pitch
[ ] Draft optional future roadmap (future improvements / AI integrations)
[ ] Prepare README.md with project overview, features, and design notes

2. Mockup / Prototype
[ ] Identify main user roles: Learner, Mentor, Admin
[ ] Sketch dashboards for each role
    [ ] Learner: AI chat, mentor suggestions, session history
    [ ] Mentor: incoming requests, points/badges, optional Q&A
    [ ] Admin: leaderboard, session oversight (simplified)
[ ] Decide which features are in MVP vs. future roadmap
[ ] Plan AI integration for chat, smart matching, and session summaries

3. Presentation / Pitch
[ ] Define problem statement: challenges learners and alumni face
[ ] Describe solution: AI + human mentorship flow
[ ] Highlight impact: accessibility, personalization, engagement
[ ] Show alignment with Per Scholas mission (equity, community, continuous learning)
[ ] Prepare visuals / demo screens to illustrate main features
[ ] Draft script and time allocation for 7–10 minutes

4. Concept & Design Considerations
[ ] Decide how AI assists without replacing human mentors
[ ] Gamification plan: points, badges, ranks
[ ] UX / UI principles: intuitive, inclusive, accessible
[ ] Sustainability & scalability ideas for alumni network growth
[ ] Define how learners get instant help while still connecting with mentors

5. Key Questions to Address
[ ] How AI improves mentorship effectiveness
[ ] How to keep alumni motivated to give back regularly
[ ] How learners get immediate support plus mentor guidance
[ ] How design remains sustainable and scalable across network

6. Coordination & Team Workflow
[ ] Assign roles for mockups, presentation, research, and design
[ ] Set timeline for weekend development / prototype
[ ] Decide which features to implement for MVP vs. future roadmap
